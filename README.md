This repository contains the lab skeleton for the **MA/PM courses**.

- `src` contains the source code for your lab.
    - `main.rs` contains the source code for the application. By default, it blinks the Pico's LED.
    - `irqs.rs` contains the definition of the `Irqs` struct that binds the interrupt ids to their handlers.
- `embassy-lab-utils` is a helper crate that contains functions and types that act as wrappers over `embassy`'s
and `embedded-hal` more complex routines.
- `cyw43-firmware` contains the firmware for the WiFi and BLE chip. It is already loaded by the `init_wifi` function
from the `embassy-lab-utils` crate.

To better understand how Rust Embedded projects are set up, please read the [debug lab](https://pmrust.pages.upb.ro/docs/acs_cc/lab/01).

## How to build and run

Make sure you have all prerequisites installed properly, as shown in the [lab tutorial](https://pmrust.pages.upb.ro/docs/acs_cc/tutorials/embassy).

The project can be built for the `thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf` target, by running in the project's root:

```shell
cargo build
```

This project is set up to automatically run `probe-rs` in order to flash the lab's board, you can simply run in the project's root:

```shell
cargo run
```
